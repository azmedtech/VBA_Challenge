#Purpose

In this activity, I evaluated a large data set of stock information to determine characteristics about the different stocks and their performance by year.

#Activity Details

1. Retrieve data from the larger data set, per page, to read and store the following values:
	-stock ticker symbol
	-volume of stock
	-open price
	-close price

2. Create Columns on the same worksheet as the raw data set for:
	-ticker symbol
	-total stock volume
	-yearly change ($)
	-percent change

3. Apply conditional formatting to show postiive change as green and negative change as red for:
	-yearly change
	-percent change

4. Generate a summary table with correct calculations to display:
	-Greatest % increase
	-Greatest % decrease
	-Greatest Total Volume

5. Add functionality to ensure VBA script runs correctly for items 1-4 aobve for all worksheets.
